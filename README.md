# CSVAI — Apply an AI prompt to each row in a CSV or Excel file and write enriched results

The `csvai` library reads an input CSV or Excel file, renders a prompt for each row (you can use raw column names like `{{ Address }}`), calls an **OpenAI model via the Responses API**, and writes the original columns plus AI-generated fields to an output CSV or Excel file.

The tool is **async + concurrent**, **resumable**, and **crash-safe**. It supports **Structured Outputs** with a **JSON Schema** for reliable JSON, or **JSON mode** (without a schema) if you prefer a lighter setup.

We also have a **CSV AI Prompt Builder** (a Custom GPT) to help you generate prompts and JSON Schemas tailored to your CSVs.

---

## Features

* **Structured Outputs**: enforce exact JSON with a schema for consistent, validated results.
* **JSON mode**: force a single JSON object without defining a schema.
* **Async & concurrent**: process many rows in parallel for faster throughput.
* **Resumable**: rows already written (by `id`) are skipped on re-run.
* **CSV or Excel**: handle `.csv` and `.xlsx` inputs and outputs.

---

## Installation

Requires Python **3.9+**.
OpenAI API Key: Create a key - https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and use it in the .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY=
See example.env in the [project repo](https://github.com/zyxware/csvai).

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install csvai
# Include Streamlit UI dependencies
pip install "csvai[ui]"
```

### From GitHub

```bash
# Install directly from the repository
pip install git+https://github.com/zyxware/csvai.git
# With Streamlit UI dependencies
pip install "csvai[ui] @ git+https://github.com/zyxware/csvai.git"
```

### For local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zyxware/csvai
cd csvai
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
cp example.env .env
# Edit .env and set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Installing the package exposes the `csvai` CLI and the `csvai-ui` command.

---

## Usage

### CLI

#### Auto-discovery

If you name your files like this:

```
input.csv      # or input.xlsx
input.prompt.txt
input.schema.json   # optional
```

Run:

```bash
csvai input.csv      # or input.xlsx
```

#### Or specify prompt & schema explicitly

```bash
# With a prompt and a strict schema (best reliability)
csvai address.xlsx --prompt address.prompt.txt --schema address.schema.json

# Or JSON mode (no schema; still a single JSON object)
csvai address.xlsx --prompt address.prompt.txt
```

Sample datasets (`address.csv` and `address.xlsx`) with the matching prompt and schema live in the `example/` directory.

### Streamlit UI

After installing with the `ui` extra, launch the web interface:

```bash
csvai-ui
```

The UI lets you upload a CSV/Excel file, provide a prompt and optional schema.

---

## Example Prompt & Schema

### Prompt (`address.prompt.txt`)

```text
Extract city, state, and country from the given address.

Rules:
- city: city/town/locality (preserve accents, proper case)
- state: ISO-standard name of the state/region/province or "" if none
- country: ISO 3166 English short name of the country; infer if obvious, else ""
- Ignore descriptors like "(EU)"
- Do not guess street-level info

Inputs:
Address: {{Address}}
```

### Schema (`address.schema.json`)

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "city": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "City, town, or locality name with correct casing and accents preserved"
    },
    "state": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "ISO-standard name of the state, region, or province, or empty string if none"
    },
    "country": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "ISO 3166 English short name of the country, inferred if obvious, else empty string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["city", "state", "country"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

## Creating Prompts & Schemas with the CSV AI Prompt Builder

You can use the **[CSV AI Prompt Builder](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-689d8067bd888191a896d2cfdab27a39-csv-ai-prompt-builder)** custom GPT to:

* Quickly design a **prompt** tailored to your CSV data.
* Generate a **JSON Schema** that matches your desired structured output.

**Example input to the builder:**

```
File: reviews.csv. Inputs: title,body,stars. Output: sentiment,summary.
```

**Example result:**

**Prompt**

```
Analyze each review and produce sentiment and a concise summary.

Rules:
- sentiment: one of positive, neutral, negative.
- Star mapping: stars ≤ 2 ⇒ negative; 3 ⇒ neutral; ≥ 4 ⇒ positive. If stars is blank or invalid, infer from tone.
- summary: 1–2 sentences, factual, include key pros/cons, no emojis, no first person, no marketing fluff.
- Use the same language as the Body.
- Return only the fields required by the tool schema.

Inputs:
Title: {{title}}
Body: {{body}}
Stars: {{stars}}
```

**Schema**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "sentiment": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Overall sentiment derived from stars and/or tone; one of positive, neutral, negative",
      "enum": ["positive", "neutral", "negative"]
    },
    "summary": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Concise 1–2 sentence summary capturing key pros/cons without opinionated fluff"
    }
  },
  "required": ["sentiment", "summary"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

**Command to execute**

```bash
python -m csvai.cli reviews.csv --prompt reviews.prompt.txt --schema reviews.schema.json
```
**Tip — have the builder generate a schema for you**
* **I have `products.csv` with Product Title, Product Description, Category, and Sub Category. Help me enrich with SEO meta fields.**
* **I have `reviews.csv` with Title, Body, and Stars. Help me extract sentiment and generate a short summary.**
* **I have `address.csv` with an Address field. Help me extract City, State, and Country using ISO-standard names.**
* **I have `tickets.csv` with Subject and Description. Help me classify each ticket into predefined support categories.**
* **I have `posts.csv` with Title, Body, URL, Image URL, Brand, and Platform. Help me generate social media captions, hashtags, emojis, CTAs, and alt text.**
* **I have `jobs.csv` with Job Title and Description. Help me categorize jobs into sectors and identify the level of seniority.**

## CLI

```bash
csvai INPUT.csv [--prompt PROMPT_FILE] [--output OUTPUT_FILE]
                          [--limit N] [--model MODEL] [--schema SCHEMA_FILE]
```

**Flags**

* `--prompt, -p` — path to a plaintext prompt file (Jinja template).
* `--output, -o` — output CSV path (default: `<input>_enriched.csv`).
* `--limit` — process only the first `N` new/pending rows.
* `--model` — model name (default from `.env`, falls back to `gpt-4o-mini`).
* `--schema` — path to a JSON Schema for structured outputs (optional).

---

## Environment Variables (`.env`)

See [`example.env`](example.env) for all configurable variables.

```ini
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
DEFAULT_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=600
TEMPERATURE=0.2
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=12
PROCESSING_BATCH_SIZE=100
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=45
ALT_PROMPT_SUFFIX=.prompt.txt
OUTPUT_FILE_SUFFIX=_enriched.csv
```

---

## Input/Output Behavior

* **Input CSV**: the script reads all rows. If an `id` column exists, it’s used to resume. If not, rows are indexed `0..N-1` internally for this run.
* **Prompt rendering**: every row is sanitized so `{{ Raw Header }}` becomes `{{ Raw_Header }}`. You can also reference the raw values as `{{ raw["Raw Header"] }}` if needed.
* **Output CSV**: contains the original columns plus AI-generated fields. The **header is fixed** after the first successful batch; later rows are written with the same header order.
* **Resume**: rerunning skips rows whose `id` is already present in the output file.

## Structured Outputs vs JSON Mode

### Structured Outputs (recommended)

When you pass `--schema`, the request includes:

```python
text={
  "format": {
    "type": "json_schema",
    "name": "row_schema",
    "schema": schema,
    "strict": true
  }
}
```

This guarantees the model returns **exactly** the keys/types you expect.

### JSON Mode (no schema)

When no schema is provided, the request includes:

```python
text={"format": {"type": "json_object"}}
```

The model must still return a single JSON object, but no exact schema is enforced.

> **Prompting tip:** mention the word **JSON** in your prompt and explicitly list the expected fields to improve compliance in JSON mode.

---

## Performance & Concurrency

* Concurrency is controlled by `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`.
* Increase gradually; too high can trigger API rate limits.
* `PROCESSING_BATCH_SIZE` controls how many results are written per batch.
* `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` guards slow requests; the script retries with backoff.

---

## Troubleshooting

**“Missing required parameter: `text.format.name`”**
You used structured outputs but didn’t include `name` **alongside** `type` and `schema`. The script already sends this correctly; ensure you’re on the latest version and that `--schema` points to the right file.

**“Invalid schema … `required` must include every key”**
The Responses structured-outputs path expects `required` to include **all** keys in `properties`. Either (a) add them all to `required`, (b) remove non-required keys from `properties`, or (c) use JSON mode.

**Rows not resuming**
Ensure there’s an `id` column in both input and output. If not present, the script uses positional IDs for the current run only.

---

## FAQ

**Q: Does it run concurrently?**
Yes. Concurrency is controlled via `MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS` (default 10).

**Q: Can I rely on an `id` column?**
Yes. If present in the input CSV, it’s used for resumability. Otherwise rows are indexed for the session.

**Q: Can I output nested JSON?**
The schema can be nested, but CSV is flat. If you want nested data, extend the script with a flattener (e.g., convert `address.street` → `address_street`).

**Q: Which models work?**
Recent `gpt-4o*` models support Responses + Structured Outputs. If a model doesn’t support it, use JSON mode.

**Q: Do I need a JSON schema?**
No, but it’s strongly recommended for stable columns and fewer parse failures.
